Future Features to Implement:

86 page / display 86'd items differently

give ALL menu items a class in the customer portal to allow for global styling css

add the back page of dessert menu

promote special events on menus for seated guests
NYE, Mothers Day, Valentines Day, Graduation, etc...

Try loading a static html file as index.html to see if it loads faster

fix footers in seated guest portal and also in managers portal

ensureAuth for all manager portal pages

confirm logic for updateItem() at bottom of updateItem.ejs
might be flawed if initial item creation has no pic, then
user wants to add a pic later?
